DEPRECATED

openshim was a shim for OpenBSD pledge and unveil syscalls using cgo. Now that
the golang.org/x/sys/unix package supports unveil it is no longer useful.

If you want it to run on both OpenBSD and non-OpenBSD systems just use build
constraints to have calls on non-OpenBSD systems be a no-op.
